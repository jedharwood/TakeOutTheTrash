# TakeOutTheTrash
CRUD app using a React/Redux UI.
My intention for this project is to provide a user with a set of rules for how and when to dispose of their refuse by prefecture/city in Japan.
I'm using a mock DB in the UI project while I figure out what shape I want the data to be. Once that's set I'll initially be writing an ASP.NET REST Api to handle requests and creatng a DB project with EntityFramework as I am most familiar with these technologies. Eventually I'd like to use the UI as a test bed to develop back end services against using other technologies as I learn them.
