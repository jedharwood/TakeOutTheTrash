# TakeOutTheTrash
A React/Redux SPA. Currently running on a JsonServer stub but I have been working on implementing back end services for it using both Ruby on Rails and .Net core.

My intention for this project is to provide a user with a set of rules for how and when to dispose of their refuse by prefecture/city in Japan.
I have recently updated the styling of the project from SASS to a mixture of TailwindCss and SASS. 
The next significant planed improvement will be to convert the project to Typescript.
